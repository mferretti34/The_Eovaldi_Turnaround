# The_Eovaldi_Turnaround
The inspiration for this project comes from reading this article:

# Basic definitions for data used in the project:
- In-Zone Percentage : From all total pitches in a season, what percentage where in the strike zone. (Pitches in the strike zone / Total pitches)
- BB% : What percentage of batters did Nate Eovaldi walk in a given season. (Total walks / Total batters faced)
- Pitch Usage : From all pitches thrown what were the percentages for each unqiue type of pitch. (xPitch.Type / Total Pitches) 

# Continuing the conversation:
The main reason why I was inspired to do this project was because while reading that article above, I identified Nathan Eovaldi as a guy who fit that similar profile as Robbie; a righty power-arm with a deep mix off secondary pitches who proved to make a turnaround during 2021.
One can expand on this project by identifying other pitchers who fit a similar profile as Eovaldi and Ray, I bet one could find a number of pitchers with a similar profile who have struggled for one reason or the other.
Try to find out what those reasons are, is he not throwing the ball over the plate consitently enough? What does his walk rate look like? Is he using his arsenal as efficiently as possible? 
Work smart not hard, control the zone, control the cound and keep hitters guessing.
